### MQTTactic
The MQTTactic is our tool for evaluating the security of MQTT Broker with static analyses. More details and instructions will be uploaded/updated later.


### Getting started
#### 1. Install
* The MQTTactic works on LLVM IR, So LLVM must be available in your system. Currently, the supported LLVM versions are `llvm-9`, `llvm-10`, `llvm-11`, `llvm-12`, and `llvm-13`.
* Haybale for symbolic execution
`git clone https://github.com/MQTTactic/Haybale`
